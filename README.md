The Nelarabine market refers to the pharmaceutical market focused on Nelarabine, a chemotherapy drug primarily used in the treatment of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Nelarabine is an anti-cancer drug that works by targeting the DNA of cancer cells, disrupting their ability to divide and proliferate, which makes it effective in treating leukemia, especially in patients who have not responded to other treatments. The drug is available under various brand names, with Arranon and Atriance being two of the primary formulations. Nelarabine is mostly administered in clinical settings like hospitals and oncology centers, where it is prescribed as part of a combination chemotherapy regimen for patients with relapsed or refractory T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
